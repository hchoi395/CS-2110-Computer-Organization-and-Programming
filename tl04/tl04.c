/**
 * \brief Add students to the queue

 * This function should allocate a [queue_node_t] on the heap, and deep-copy

 * require their own dedicated memory allocation. Below are the declarations
 * of the [queue_node_t] and [student_t] structs:
 *

 *  struct student_t data;     ///< The student held by this node
 *  struct queue_node_t *next; ///< Pointer to next node of list (or `NULL`)
 * };

 *  char *name;  
 *  enum assignment_t assignment;
 * };
 * 
 * Note: Make sure that all members of the [queue_node_t] are set!
 * 
 * Finally, insert the student into the queue with the help of the [queue_head]
 * and/or [queue_tail] pointers.
 * 
 * Refer back to the PDF/diagram for specific details about how to link the
 * nodes, and consider any edge cases.
 *
 * This function should return `SUCCESS` if the student was added successfully.
 * If it fails, it should return `FAILURE` and leave the list unchanged. It
 * should fail if and only if:

 * * the student's name is `NULL`, or

 * The way this function returns the student data using the data out technique.
 * This is to get around the limitation that functions may only have one return
 * value. As such, the caller will pass in a pointer where the student's data
 * should be stored. Then this function will store the returned data at that
 * pointer. Independently, it returns whether it succeeded via the normal path.

 * and/or [queue_tail] pointers.
 * 
 * Refer back to the PDF/diagram for specific details about how to link the
 * nodes, and consider any edge cases.
 * 
 * Remember to free the node when you're done. A copy of the data is being
 * returned, the node containing the data is not. The node will no longer be
 * accessible when the function returns, so it should be freed.
 *
 * If this function succeeds, it should return `SUCCESS` and modify `*data` to
 * be the data of the student removed. If it fails, it should return `FAILURE`
 * and leave both the list and `*data` unchanged. It should fail if and only if:
